2003.1125 2003-11-25
	- Various folks have complained that JulianDay isn't correct.  An
	  errata section has been added to the documentation.
	- Mark Ivey <mivey@r2tech.com> add '@' as a synonym for 'at'.
	  Fixed typos.  
	- Bryan Henderson <bryanh@giraffe-data.com> sent in a patch to
	  allow NOW => 0 so that ParseDate can be used to parse relative
	  times. 
	- ewan@baremetal.com sent in a patch adding a bit of ISO 8601
	  support.
	- David Alban <david@responsible.com> doesn't like allowing the
	  hour 24:00.  I agree.  Gone if you have VALIDATE=>1.
	- Still to be done: the support the large number of ISO 8601 
	  date formats: http://hydracen.com/dx/iso8601.htm
2003.0211 2003-02-11
	- Mike Cramer <cramer@webkist.com> sent a patch to Timezone to
	  handle changes in $ENV{TZ}. 
	- Rani Pinchuk <rani@cpan.org> sent in a definition for the
	  CEST timezone.
	- On Phil.Moore@msdw.com's behalf the timezone 'MET DST' is now
	  supported.
2002.1001 2002-10-01
	- No real changes, just added a license.
101.062001 2001-06-20
	- Paul Zimmer <pzimmer@bepress.com> found that '7/17/01' with
	  PREFER_FUTURE failed badly.  Fixed.  This was also submitted
	  by Dana Burd <DBurd@cpr.org>.
	- Ben Daglish <bdaglish@yahoo.com> noted that array context
	  was implying WHOLE and DATE_REQUIRED.  Fixed.
	- Streppone Cosimo <cstrep@idgroup.it> requested support for
	  postgresql's date format ("dd/mm/yyyy hh:mn:ss +tzo")
	- Ameeth Linus Daniel <linus@teil.soft.net> found that IST wasn't 
	  a defined timezone.  I've defined it as +0530, but I'm not 
	  positive that's correct.
	- Gautam Tripathi <dayalpura@hotmail.com> sent in a fix for
	  timezone offset calculations making them consistent across
	  all systems (no more problems with differing interpretations
	  of negative modulus operations).
	- Mike Nerone <mnerone@idworld.net> requested the syntax 
	  "4 days ago".  He says that that syntax is suppored by
	  GNU date.  This was also requested by Townsend, John E. 
	  <John.Townsend@lexis-nexis.com>.
	- Anton Berezin <tobez@heechee.tobez.org> notice that ParseDate
	  couldn't handle "Sunday, 06-Nov-94 08:49:37 GMT" and sent
	  in a patch.
100.010301 2000-01-03
	- W. Phillip Moore <Phil.Moore@msdw.com> reproted a Y2K bug: it could
	  not parse 'Jan  1 2000 10:30:30AM'.  Fixed.  This is embarassing
	  beasue <alangmead@boston.com> sent in a patch Dec 9th!
99.111701 1999-11-17
	- Allen Smith <easmith@beatrice.rutgers.edu> noticed that VALIDATE
	  wouldn't accept hours > 0...  
	- Hugh C Kennedy <kennedyh@engin.umich.edu> contributed patches to
	  parse months like `Jan.' in additon to `Jan' and `January'.
99.062401 1999-06-24:
	- Randy Kobes <randy@theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca> sent in a fix for
	  Timezone.pm that allows all tests to pass on MSWin32.
99.062301:
	- Eric Prestemon <ecp@adknowledge.com> noticed that %y would print
	  "0" in 2000, not "00" as it should.  Fixed.
	- Parsedate() now checks for wantarray() and returns what remains of
	  its input when called from array context.
	- Added another parsing option: VALIDATE.  When VALIDATE is set,
	  silly values for hours, months, etc will be rejected.  Like the
	  32nd of December will no longer be new years day.
99.062201 1999-06-22
	- Optionally return fractional seconds from ParseDate (including 
	  the SYBASE formatted ones).  Provide for printing fractional
	  seconds in CTime.  Changes from Douglas Wegscheid 
	  <wegscd@whirlpool.com>
99.061601 1999-06-16
	- More attempts to support systems whose time function isn't 
	  centered around Jan 1, 1970 midnight GMT.
99.061501 1999-05-15
	- Fixed a couple of compiler warnings.  Did extensive testing with
	  dates beyond 2000 and before 1970.  Quite a few code changes.
	  Old code would have worked in many > 2000 cases but broke 
	  terribly for dates < 1970.
	  New code should work until year 10k.  Well, there's one problem:
	  unix time format is only 32 bits, signed. 
98.112901 1998-11-29
	- Slight change to avoid an "Use of uninitialized value" error
	  pointed out by Mike Coffin <mhc@Eng.Sun.COM>.
98.112801 1998-11-12
	- It turns out that Sybase emits time values like "3:09:59:000PM".  The
	  last three digits are milliseconds.  Such times are now recognized
	  but the milliseconds are ignored.  Change requested by
	  ryanmcleish <ryan@email.labmed.umn.edu>.
	- Corrected the documenation on strftime conversions for %d and %e.  The
	  code and the documentation now agree:
		%d - 01 to 31
		%e -  1 to 31
98.052201 1998-05-22
	- Minor bugfix: didn't recognize 5/18/1998.
97.092101 1997-09-21
	- Fix a 5.004 warning.
	- Add support for "June 4, 1997"
96.110801 1996-11-08
	- Added support for negative relative times.
	- Bugfix: "now" by itself was ignored.
	- Bugfix: could not combine "now" with time offsets (only date offsets)
96.032801 1996-03-28
	- Added support for "TZN
96.032702 1996-03-27
	- This is the first release to use the Makefile.PL 
	  packaging.  There are many changes with repect to 
	  previous releases.  All modules now running with -w and
	  use strict.
	- CTime.pm: should be faster
	- ParseDate.pm: core logic changed, more dates parsed.
	- datetime.t: more tests
	- Timezone.pm: ripped out tzset code and replaced it
	  with code from Graham Barr <bodg@tiuk.ti.com>
